# Tzientist

A Scientist-like library for Node.js, implemented in TypeScript.

It permits comparing legacy and refactored code paths in production environments,
verifying both functional and non-functional requirements.
This is also known as the Parallel Run pattern.

## Installation

`npm i tzientist`

or

`yarn add tzientist`

## Getting started

```TypeScript
import * as scientist from 'tzientist';

const experiment = scientist.experiment({
  name: 'trial1',
  control: (s: string) => 'Control ' + s,
  candidate: (s: string) => 'not quite right ' + s
});

console.log(experiment('C'));
```

This uses the default options and prints:

```Text
Experiment trial1: difference found
Control C
```

The `control` is the source of truth. It's typically the legacy code you're trying to replace. The `experiment` will always return whatever the `control` returns (or will throw if the `control` throws).

The `candidate` is the new code you're testing that's intended to replace the `control` eventually. The `experiment` runs this code and publishes the result (along with the `control` result). The `experiment` will swallow any errors thrown by the `candidate`.

The `experiment` runs both the `control` and the `candidate`, and it publishes the results to a callback function. Normally you will provide a custom `publish` function in the options that will report the results to some location for later analysis.

### Publishing results

```TypeScript
function publish(results: scientist.Results<string>): void {
  if (results.candidateResult !== results.controlResult) {
    console.log(
      `Experiment ${results.experimentName}: expected "${results.controlResult}" but got "${results.candidateResult}"`
    );
  }
}

const experiment = scientist.experiment({
  name: 'trial2',
  control: (s: string) => 'Control ' + s,
  candidate: (s: string) => 'not quite right ' + s,
  options: { publish }
});

console.log(experiment('C'));
```

This prints:

```Text
Experiment trial2: expected "Control C" but got "not quite right C"
Control C
```

You will probably want to check `results.candidateError` and `results.controlError` as well.

Typically you would replace `console.log` in `publish` with a call to a logging framework, persisting to a database, sending metrics to Grafana, etc.

### Sampling

Running experiments can be expensive. Both the control and the candidate execute. If either may be slow or if the experiment runs in a performance-sensitive context, you may want to run the experiment on a percentage of traffic. You can provide a custom `enabled` function in the options. If `enabled` returns `false`, the experiment will still return what the control returns but it will not call the candidate nor will it publish results. If `enabled` returns `true`, the experiment will run normally. Tzientist passes the arguments to the experiment to the `enabled` function in case you want to base the sampling on them.

```TypeScript
function enabled(_: string): boolean {
  // Run candidate 25% of the time
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1) <= 25;
}

const experiment = scientist.experiment({
  name: 'trial3',
  control: (s: string) => 'Control ' + s,
  candidate: (s: string) => 'not quite right ' + s,
  options: { enabled }
});
```

## FAQ

Q. Why would I use this library?

A. You want to refactor or replace existing code, but that code is difficult or impossible to test with automated unit or integration tests. Perhaps it's nondeterministic. It might rely on data or on user input that is only available in a production environment. It could be a combinatorial explosion of states that requires too many test cases. Typically you would use this for high-risk changes, since you'll want to run the experiment for some time in production and check the results.

---

Q. My candidate and control take different parameters. How do I handle that?

A. Create a facade for one or both so that the parameters match. You don't need to use all of the parameters in both functions.

---

Q. How do I configure custom compare, clean, or ignore functions?

A. Tzientist always publishes results, so you can do all of the above in your `publish` function. `publish` can also delegate to other functions.

---

Q. How do I configure a custom run_if function to conditionally disable an experiment?

A. Tzientist passes the arguments to the experiment to the `enabled` function (if this is present in the options). If `enabled` returns `false`, the experiment will still return what the control returns but it will not call the candidate nor will it publish results.

---

Q. What are some guidelines for writing `publish` functions?

A.

- `publish` should be fast
- `publish` should **not** throw (it should catch any errors)

## To do

- Async support.
- Timer support.

## Why

GitHub's [Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) Ruby library is a brilliant concept. Unfortunately the Node.js alternatives aren't very TypeScript-friendly.

The goals of this project:

- Simplicity
- TypeScript support
- Easy setup
- Reasonable defaults
- Good documentation
- High test coverage

Feature parity with Scientist is _not_ a goal.

## Contributing

### Technology stack

- TypeScript v3.8
- Node v12 (should work on v8.17.0 or higher)
- npm v6 (I like yarn, but not everyone does)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- ESLint
- Jest

### Standards

- TypeScript strict option
- No classes
- Prettier with single quotes
- No ESLint warnings/errors
- All tests pass
- No dependencies (other than devDependencies)
- [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

**Note**: I use Mac OS, which uses Unix style (LF) line breaks. I haven't added a .gitattributes file yet.
