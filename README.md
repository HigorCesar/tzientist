# Tzientist

A Scientist-like library implemented in TypeScript.

It permits comparing legacy and refactored code paths in production environments.

## Why

The Ruby [Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) library is a brilliant concept. Unfortunately the Node.js alternatives aren't very TypeScript-friendly.

The goals of this project:

* Simplicity
* TypeScript support
* Easy setup
* Reasonable defaults
* Good documentation
* High test coverage

Feature parity with Scientist is _not_ a goal.

## About the name

I love puns, gaming, and vampires. Tzientist is named after the Tzimisce vampire clan from the game Vampire: The Masquerade; they are the ultimate scientists.
